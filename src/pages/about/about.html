  <p>ArLane is a research collaboration between <a href="http://tech.cornell.edu">Cornell Tech</a> and <a href="http://aol.com">AOL</a>, in the context of the Connected Experience Lab.</p>

  <p>The ArLane proof-of-concept explores innovative ways to use mixed reality for an in-store shopping experience. It is built using Microsoft HoloLens technology and leverages some recent research done by professor <a href="https://www.shiriazenkot.com/">Shiri Azenkot</a> at Cornell Tech.</p>

 <p>The proof-of-concept demo will run in the AOL Lab in New York City. The lab setting simulates a brick and mortar store, with physical items on shelves. Shoppers will use ArLane to enrich their in-store experience: as they gaze at an item, ArLane provides extra information about the item in the form of a virtual info card. The info card appears next to the item and can be flipped for more information about related items.</p>

<p>The ArLane proof-of-concept explores various dimensions of a mixed reality experience, including multimodal interfaces (eye, voice, gesture), information overlay, animation, use of rich media content, communication with external application, etc.
The code used for the proof-of-concept is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/cornelltech/aol-hololens-companion">Github</a>.</p>
