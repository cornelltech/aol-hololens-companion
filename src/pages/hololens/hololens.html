  <h3>What is Mirosoft HoloLens</h3>
  <p>"The HoloLens is a head-mounted display unit connected to an adjustable, cushioned inner headband, which can tilt HoloLens up and down, as well as forward and backward.To wear the unit, the user fits the HoloLens on their head, using an adjustment wheel at the back of the headband to secure it around the crown, supporting and distributing the weight of the unit equally for comfort,[9] before tilting the visor towards the front of the eyes." (source: Wikipedia)</p>

  <p>"HoloLens uses sensual and natural interface commands—gaze, gesture, and voice inputs. Gaze commands, such as head-tracking, allows the user to bring application focus to whatever the user is perceiving. "Elements"—or any virtual application or button—are selected using an air tap method, similar to clicking an imaginary computer mouse. The tap can be held for a drag simulation to move an element, as well as voice commands for certain commands and actions." (source: Wikipedia)</p>
